# Changelog

Notable changes to vla.cpp. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-04

### Added
- `vla-cli`: one-shot inference from the command line (image + tokens to action), no server needed.
- `scripts/quantize_gguf.py`: repack LM weights to Q8_0/Q4_0. The loader runs quantized GGUFs directly (Q8_0 roughly halves the LM, near-lossless).

### Changed
- One shared GGUF reader across the model loaders, replacing the per-arch copies.
- Cap inbound message size (256 MiB) and image count (16) on `vla-server` and `vlm-server`.
- Scale CPU threads to the machine core count across all loaders instead of a fixed 4.
- Read GGUF file offsets as 64-bit and reject non-float embedding tensors in row-fetch.

### Fixed
- Reject out-of-range language tokens in OpenVLA-OFT and VLA-Adapter.
- Zero the padded action dimensions so only real action dims carry values.
- Reject images that do not match the model input size in VLA-Adapter and OpenVLA-OFT (out-of-bounds read on a smaller view).
- Validate Evo-1 action dims at load so a client-supplied noise buffer cannot underrun.
- Only enable the BitVLA CUDA path once every device buffer allocates.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-03

First tagged release. One self-contained GGUF per model (vision tower + LM + action
expert + dataset stats), CPU or CUDA, no external mmproj and no patch to llama.cpp.

### Added
- Seven VLA policies auto-detected from the GGUF: SmolVLA, pi0, BitVLA, Evo-1, GR00T N1.5/N1.6/N1.7.
- In-tree vision towers (SigLIP, BitSigLIP, InternViT, RADIO) on stable public ggml/llama APIs.
- ZeroMQ + protobuf `vla-server`; a separate `vlm-server` for VLM chat.
- BitVLA 1.58-bit custom ternary CUDA kernels.
- Per-arch HuggingFace -> GGUF converters and mmproj-merge helpers (`scripts/`).
- Robot eval harness for LIBERO, SimplerEnv, and ALOHA (`eval/`), with device benchmark reports.
- Minimal CI: pixel-shuffle unit test, converter-remap test, CPU build gate.
- `pyproject.toml` for the Python tooling and a CUDA `Dockerfile` for `vla-server`.

### Changed
- llama.cpp is fetched + pinned via CMake `FetchContent` (tag `b9866`); bumping is a
  one-line `GIT_TAG` change. Removed the `patches/` fetch script.
